This is largely based off a clone of [ShareMeow](https://github.com/producthunt/ShareMeow/) made by the awesome folks at [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com) - It's a Ruby microservice (ooh ahh) for creating super shareable, tweetable, facebook-able images from your content :heart_eyes_cat:. You define a template (using HTML/CSS), pass it some parameters, and it will generate an image to you.

We've modified it at Tress to create a shareable snapshot of questions asked on Tress Q&A section.
